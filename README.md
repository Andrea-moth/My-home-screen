## For home page
***:exclamation:   Only works for firefox***

Open [index.html](index.html)

Go to Firefox settings in a new tab

Select custom url in the Homepage and new windows sections

Copy the address of index.html into the url box

---
***Alternative***

Open [index.html](index.html)

Drag the tab down to the home icon 


## For new tab 

***Don't feel bad for stealing my work just leave [README.md](README.md) intact***

Create your own git repo and copy these files into it 

Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/dashboard) and link your github acount 

When Github asks you to confirm permissions select all or the specific repo you've just made

Create a new project in Vercel and use the repo you've just made 

Once it's finished building go to [New Tab Overide](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/new-tab-override/) and install it

When it's installed click on the icon in your tab bar, go to the URL section and enter https://{repo name}.vercel.app/

## ToDo

- [ ] Refactor styling to allow for multiple window sizes and formats
